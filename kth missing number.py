k-th missing element in sorted array
Given an increasing sequence a[], we need to find the K-th missing contiguous element in the increasing sequence which is not present in the sequence. If no k-th missing element is there output -1.

Examples :

Input :   a[] = {2, 3, 5, 9, 10};   
            k = 1;
Output : 4
Explanation: Missing Element in the increasing 
sequence are {4, 6, 7, 8}. So k-th missing element
is 4

Input : a[] = {2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12};       
          k = 4;
Output : 8
Explanation: missing element in the increasing 
sequence are {4, 6, 7, 8}  so k-th missing 
element is 8
